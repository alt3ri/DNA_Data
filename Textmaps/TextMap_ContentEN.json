Once out on his own, Arnold has spent countless hours strategising on how to survive the bitter cold of the night.\\\r\n\\\r\nWith his few possessions, Arnold managed to scrape together some goods to sell outside the theatre to make ends meet, but business has been slow — the townsfolk of Icelake show little interest in the arts. There is one exception — a pompous nobleman who frequents the theatre. Arnold has a somewhat positive impression of him. This nobleman consistently supports Arnold's small venture and intriguingly, has never bought any fermented drinks. Driven by curiosity, Arnold once asked him about it. The nobleman, through elaborate explanations, shared that he had a severe intolerance to alcohol — even a mere touch on his lips could induce an unintended slumber.\\\r\n\\\r\nWith this loyal patron's support, Arnold managed to scrape by until this brutally cold winter made survival even more challenging. His meagre savings are insufficient to purchase the necessary fuel to keep warm. A daring idea then took root in his desperate mind...\\\r\n\\\r\nOne evening, he followed the nobleman home and slipped through a window left slightly ajar. Inside, the nobleman's residence was modest for his rank — no servants were in sight, and the hearth was barely warm. Yet, compared to the icy streets, it was a sanctuary. \\\r\n\\\r\nArnold tiptoed into the kitchen and spiked the kettle with a bit of alcohol, then waited patiently for the nobleman to return from the theatre and take a sip.

The regulars at the local tavern often jest that without it, Mr Buck's penchant for flowery prose and lack of practical skills would inevitably lead him to a life under a bridge.\\\r\n\\\r\nIt's a fair observation. Even in his beloved realm of creative writing, Mr Buck has struggled to leave a mark. His scripts, submitted with a hopeful heart to the Hegon Theater, have yet to grace the stage — and likely never will. Thus, Mr Buck spends his days lingering forlornly outside the theatre, reciting verses that echo the melancholy of autumn and the slow descent of leaves.\\\r\n\\\r\nRecently, Mr Buck has been pouring his soul into crafting a new tragedy, one enveloping themes of moonlight, graves, separated lovers, regrets, and the sombre intertwining of love and death. Perhaps overinvested in his work or wearied by the theatre's constant rejection, he has grown increasingly paranoid. He insists that he hears footsteps and detects odd scents in his room, oddities that coincide with mysterious bouts of deep sleep that steal away his creative nights.\\\r\n\\\r\nDespite these disturbances, Mr Buck hasn't actually lost anything of tangible value — arguably, his enforced regular sleep might even be seen as a positive development, given his otherwise nocturnal toils.

Yet, she chose to walk away at the height of her career and start anew in Icelake.\\\r\n\\\r\nNow, Ms Lina makes her living as a freelance housekeeper, providing top-notch, impartial service to anyone in need. She provides extensive services — from daily household chores and meal preparation to organising large banquets, caring for the disabled and elderly, and even managing sensitive tasks like body preparation, property rentals, pre-arranging gravesites, workers' compensation filings, and cremation arrangements. Despite frequent solicitations from local nobles who crave the opulent services she once rendered in the capital, Lina consistently declines, choosing instead to focus her efforts on aiding those most in need and discreetly supporting the Charon community.\\\r\n\\\r\nWhat few know is that her decision to leave the ducal household was triggered by an encounter with Henrik.\\\r\n\\\r\nBack then, Henrik was an itinerant doctor and was invited to consult at the ducal palace. One day, as Lina escorted Henrik back to his lodgings, a Charon collapsed in front of them — a common enough sight in the harsh winter that Lina had grown numb to such tragedies. Unlike her, Henrik immediately rushed to help, asking Lina to fetch some hot water for the stranger.\\\r\n\\\r\nAs she assisted Henrik in caring for the pale, ailing girl, Lina felt a long-dormant compassion stir within her. She realised that, while her role was meant to be about caring for others, it often reduced her to merely cleaning up after the noble's messes, and her seemingly superior status and living conditions didn't seem to be worth it anymore. Working alongside someone with a heart of gold like Henrik, she felt deeply ashamed.\\\r\n\\\r\nThroughout Henrik's stay, Lina assisted him with his patients as much as she could, yearning to break free from the guilt that weighed on her, yet struggling to fully commit to change. Henrik, perceiving her inner conflict, did not probe further; instead, he left her with an address in Icelake as he departed, suggesting that should she seek a place of refuge and purpose, she would find it there.\\\r\n\\\r\nThat place is now known to all as the Hypnos' House.",

    "ContentEN": "...\\\r\nAll readers know that the author has always lived a solitary life. \\\r\nThe benefits of solitude are obvious. Firstly, we can crush and refine precious gems purchased at great expense without hesitation, and without worrying about these valuable materials being used as gifts to win the favour of others. \\\r\n(Note: Of course, gems can only fulfil their true value in the hands of an alchemist.)\\\r\nSecondly, those who live alone will have more energy to experiment with the wonders of alchemy, rather than feeling deep regret upon finding their first strand of grey hair, and realising that one should not have been overly obsessed with fruitless love like the author. \\\r\n(Note: This sounds somewhat extreme, but in today's Empire, who isn't extreme?) \\\r\nAnd lastly, maintaining a solitary life can also prevent some unfortunate events from happening, like the following: \\\r\nAlong the northern border of the Siberian Empire, there is a city called Icelake (Note: My teacher once went there, supposedly to visit a doctor named Enrique, but unfortunately I didn't inquire further), which produces Crystallo of Stella. It has a cold climate that makes it suitable for conducting research into the fire element. \\\r\nAnd the protagonist of this incident? Poor Vagim. He was one of the many alchemists in this region who specialised in the use of fire. He was 40 years old at the time, an age when many alchemists eventually achieved success. However, his greatest achievement at that time was not in alchemy but in having a child who was too clever and had a great interest in alchemy. \\\r\n(Annotation: A bit too harsh.)\\\r\nOne winter morning, at the insistence of young Igor, Vagim took his son to the alchemy workshop. Naturally, the presence of a child, which are unpredictable, dangerous, and uncontrollable creatures, resulted in an explosive situation in the alchemy workshop. \\\r\nThe events that followed were not witnessed by anyone, but based on eyewitness testimonies and an analysis of the scene, it is believed that the following occurred: \\\r\nVagim prepared the most materials: Beast Wax, a small amount of Phoxene powder, and a heating crucible. Under his guidance, young Igor followed the classic process and proportions, causing a small and continuously burning fireball to appear in the crucible. \\\r\n(Note: This is very basic, but this successful attempt shows that the child had some talent.)\\\r\nFor a child, Igor did remarkably well, and Vagim must have thought so too because he instantly praised his son. But unfortunately, this misled the young Igor, who thought that as long as he created a large enough fireball, he would receive even more praise. \\\r\nSo, while Vagim was focused on preparing his own experiment, Igor, probably with the intention of surprising his father, added an entire block of Beast Wax to the crucible. \\\r\n(Note: Although understandable, this act was completely unforgivable.)\\\r\n\\\r\nOn that day, Icelake experienced its largest fire since its founding. And the epicenter of the fire was Vagim's workshop. The likely cause was the excessive addition of experimental reactants. Any novice alchemist who had thoroughly read the “Alchemist Safety Guidelines” would not have made such a mistake. However, we cannot blame a child for this. Without a doubt, Vagim was the one responsible for this incident. \\\r\nIt can only be said that, as an alchemist, maintaining a solitary life is a virtue that benefits both scientific endeavours and the greater good of society. \\\r\n(Note: This is a painful lesson, so I should also be more careful in future.)",

By the time he arrived, his Deterioration had already reached an advanced stage. Today, when I had to tell him his time was running out, this young man, taller than me, broke down, crying and pleading for a chance at life. He's only eighteen — with loving parents, devoted mentors, and a newfound love. It broke my heart, but I had to steel myself and remind him of the harsh reality: this is his destined fate. In truth, I was preparing to restart trials for an anti-Deterioration drug, but with high risks and no guarantees, I couldn't give him false hope. The cruellest thing in this world isn't despair — it's offering hope, only to take it away later.\\\r\n...\\\r\nMia clutched the pocket watch Hunt had given her, tears streaming down her face as she softly hummed a tune, even though Hunt could no longer hear her.

As she ran, the clamour of the village receded, and the wind whistling through charred branches filled the air with mournful sounds. Abigail reassured herself it wasn't the Filthoids, pressing a hand to her chest to steady her racing heart before keeping on.\\\r\nFor the villagers, the mountains were not a place to visit these days. Just two days ago, they had heard a deafening roar from the abandoned temple in the mountains, followed by a fire that was fortunately doused by a sudden downpour. Some claimed it was the goddess punishing them for their irreverence; others whispered it was the work of the woman who lived in the mountains, or that the Filthoids had been roused. Despite the varied theories, everyone agreed on one thing: stay away from the mountain, at least for now.\\\r\nBut Abigail had no choice. Her mother's gout had worsened, and Abigail had heard her mother's pained groans echoing through the night. She knew of a medicinal herb near the temple that might offer relief. Despite the risks, she resolved to make the journey.\\\r\nPreoccupied with her destination, she failed to notice what lay hidden in the undergrowth and was brought down by something soft underfoot.

In the early days after escaping the Legion, she followed the woman who had rescued her, enduring nights in damp, dark caves, braving tempests on churning seas, and evading Imperial pursuers along precipitous cliffs. No matter how harsh or dangerous the circumstances, she never once complained or paused for rest.\\\r\nYet, more difficult than enduring pain was the challenge of forgetting it.\\\r\nEven after escaping that prison and successfully evading endless pursuit, the shadows of her past lingered. Even after settling down on Purgatorio Island, remnants of her old life persistently haunted her: she would wake up before dawn, sitting blankly for long moments before realising there was no longer a need for early morning training. Despite food being within easy reach, she would wait until the designated mealtime to eat. When sick or injured, she bore the discomfort silently, never seeking help. If she accidentally came into physical contact with anyone, she instinctively recoiled, sometimes even taking a battle stance. Occasionally, even a bird flying past the window could jolt her into alertness.\\\r\nThen she met you — small, soft, exuding innocence from within the embrace of that woman, your smile untainted by the world. Tentatively, she touched your cheek, and you clutched her finger with your tiny hand. You seemed so delicate, as if the slightest danger could easily snuff out your life.\\\r\nFor the first time, Berenica felt a deep urge to protect someone. To set a good example for you, she disciplined herself to adopt regular sleeping and waking routines. To ensure your healthy growth, she experimented with various foods, clumsily collecting all sorts of ingredients that people said were delicious. To care for your health, she learned to recognise the signs of illness — like how catching a cold would bring coughs, and heatstroke would cause dizziness. To avoid frightening you, she trained herself to suppress her instinctual defensive reactions and began to smile more often. As she watched you grow, she gradually rediscovered herself, reclaiming the human experiences and feelings she thought she had long lost.\\\r\nOne ordinary afternoon, after cleaning the house, Berenica leaned back in her chair and inadvertently dozed off. In her half-sleep, she felt a familiar touch on her face. When she opened her eyes, there you were, having clambered onto the table, gently poking her cheek with your little fingers. This was perhaps the first time she had ever allowed someone to be in a position to potentially harm her. Berenica smiled and gently pinched your cheek in return. At that moment, she felt an undeniable sense of truly being alive in this world.\\\r\nIf anyone were to ask Berenica why you mean so much to her, the answer would likely be simple — it was your presence that finally allowed her to transform from the Empire's weapon, \\",

Meanwhile, those who favoured darker tales hinted at sorcery, claiming the widow's Charon daughter had ensnared the wealthy industrialist with dark magic to usurp his fortune.\\\r\nThe truth, however, remained shrouded in mystery.

Cats being chased by dogs on foreign streets, lovers whispering beneath towering city walls, stories from years past that did not align with what books said, and so on.\\\r\nLady Concerto, Hilda's mother, never shared too much about herself. The dangers she had experienced were hard to put into words, and to those who listened, they might even carry a sense of romance. She didn't want to see her daughter treading the same path as her. Although she did not hate her profession, that did not mean she wanted others to go through what she had.\\\r\nHowever, her father who was rarely present held a different perspective when he returned from overseas. He believed that Hilda should embrace the shadows just like her parents and become an agent herself. Perhaps, a big part of his motivation was due to his genuine loyalty to the Empire, but more importantly, it stemmed from the fact that Hilda, being born into such a family, could hardly have a normal life. Even if she did not join the Legion, they would still find ways to recruit her.\\\r\nOnce her parents' difference in opinion arose, her life became like a cracked canvas. Fragile and difficult to mend.\\\r\nOn the day Hilda saw her father for the second time, she heard an enormous argument between her parents. It was so loud it sounded like the walls of the house were breaking down. The clash between the two agents suddenly shifted from a verbal argument to a living room-scale conflict that could easily draw the attention of nearby Legion soldiers.\\\r\nAt this moment, Hilda made a decision. She became determined to mend her abnormal family, and within her heart, the seed of adventure bloomed to life. She wanted to see her parents more often and in more places, and speak to them more often. She even fantasised about carrying out covert missions in the shadows alongside her parents, with the only bright things before her being the gleaming of blades and their concerned eyes.\\\r\nTherefore, on one snowy night at the age of 15, Hilda bid farewell to her poems and her bright home, and knocked on the door which led to a dark place. This was a runaway plan with a clear goal. Hilda started to learn about the things that her mother mentioned in their daily talks: guns, ammunition, and weapons...\\\r\nIn the end, she officially joined the 4th Legion, becoming a thorn among flowers, poison within honey, and a shadow under the moon, just like her mother.",

This was her first mission, and the name of the target was Flora. She was the daughter of a noble whose status was so eminent that it was difficult to put into words. Her mission was to disguise herself as a maid, closely follow this nobleman's daughter, ensure her safety, and await further instructions.\\\r\nHilda repeated her mission guidelines in her head, feeling both curious and slightly nervous. She passed through three heavy doors and finally set eyes on her target surrounded by a vast expanse of flowers. She appeared to be of a similar age to her.\\\r\nAt that moment, Hilda, who had considered herself a qualified agent, suddenly felt a hint of panic. Whether it was the unchanged indifference in Flora's eyes upon seeing her, or the dazzling courtyard adorned with gilded decorations and high walls, everything completely overwhelmed her.\\\r\nAs the important people who escorted Hilda there departed and the doors slammed shut behind them, the two of them were left alone in the courtyard. Flora, who had remained silent the whole time, slowly broke into a smile. Later, Hilda came to realise that she was the first person of her age that Flora had ever met. Perhaps this was why the rarely expressive noble lady finally smiled after such a long time.\\\r\nFrom then on, the two of them lived like a typical mistress and servant in a courtyard that resembled a golden birdcage, enjoying a comfortable life together. They laughed, played, and tended to flowers every day. And on every moonless night, she would don her old agent attire and report on her findings.\\\r\nOccasionally, Hilda would feel guilty about betraying Flora's trust, but the thought that her behaviour was driven by the need to protect Flora drove her to continue these covert operations, despite her self-loathing.\\\r\nOutside the golden birdcage, Hilda's family had not undergone any fundamental changes. During her training, she had heard countless rumours about Lady Concerto, but she had never encountered her mother within the ranks of the Legion. As for her father, she heard no information about him whatsoever. Given his status, she could not work out whether he had gone on even more secretive missions or if he had met an unfortunate end far from home.\\\r\nOne day, Hilda returned home on the night of a full moon and waited for her mother, who always brought her a bouquet of flowers, cold desserts, and endless urging for Hilda to leave the Legion. After Hilda became Flora's maid, Lady Concerto behaved more like an ordinary mother, repeatedly persuading Hilda to leave the Legion and live a normal life. Despite both mother and daughter being aware that the 4th Legion was far from a nobleman's ball, a graceful exit could be achieved with proper etiquette. However, now they could only dance alone, apart from each other, and never coming to a stop.",

In that moment, Hilda came face to face with a side of her mother she had never known. Within the palace's most extreme circles of power, certain forces had gained the support of the deputy chief of the 4th Legion. Their intention was to eliminate destabilising individuals within the Empire, and the most crucial element of this plan was to eliminate Flora. And the one assigned to carry out this task was none other than Lady Concerto herself.\\\r\nThis was not surprising. Lady Concerto was a legend in the Legion. She never failed a mission.

The common folk hardly ever heard her name, but whenever there was an inexplicable explosion, an assassination, or turmoil anywhere, members of the 4th Legion instinctively knew that Lady Concerto had succeeded in another mission.\\\r\nHilda found it difficult to connect these deeds with her own mother, which was why she still retained those memories.\\\r\nIn her earlier memories, carefully pruned like flower branches, only the finest fragments remained. Such as the moment she first saw her father when she was 10, or when she learned a word that meant sweetness but also meant peculiar. There was also the time she finished reading the poetry collection her mother had brought her. Her mother was forever patient with a gentle smile on her face, and would occasionally respond in kind.\\\r\nHowever, at the core of Hilda's heart, there remained an image of her mother that was strikingly clear.\\\r\nThat image was from the night when her father returned for the second time and had a big argument with her mother. It was unclear whether it was due to not seeing her mother's face for a long time or the moonlight not being bright enough, but on that night, Hilda suddenly noticed that her mother's face had gained a few more wrinkles, much like the not-so-fresh flowers she brought back. As she looked at her mother's troubled expression, Hilda began to contemplate the possibility of a different path in life.\\\r\nThat path might be filled with thorns, but it could also mean releasing the invisible chains that bound her to her mother.\\\r\nAnd so, Hilda made up her mind and plunged into the shadows. Contrary to her wishes, her interactions with her mother not only decreased but even the past memories of their time together became difficult to recreate. After that, there were no more poems or songs, only advice and dissatisfaction.\\\r\nAnd so, when that crucial document appeared before her, the image of her mother in Hilda's heart crumbled into dust, much like a dried flower.\\\r\nAfter that, Hilda never saw her mother again. She only heard that she had faltered in a crucial mission and was no longer the admired agent she once was within the Legion. She was demoted to another nation, and very few people saw her again.\\\r\nOn occasion, she would ponder whether the once undefeated Lady Concerto had left that crucial plan out of negligence or if she had done it on purpose. However, she did not want to know the answer to this question. Just as she was no longer curious about where her father and mother might be, who they might have met, and how they might be living their lives.",

After comforting that distraught girl, Psyche came to the pile of mess below the window alone, pruned the damaged stems and roots, collected the shattered pots, and painstakingly glued them back together. Under Psyche's meticulous care, those once nearly doomed flowers survived, flourishing even more vigorously than before.",
